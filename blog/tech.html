				<h1>A Brief Overview of Ruby On Rails</h1>
				<h4>February 19, 2016</h4>
				<h4>What is Rails?</h4>

				<p>Ruby On Rails is a relatively new open source full-stack web development framework that was developed by David  Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) in 2004. Rails, itself, is not a language.  It is simply a structure that uses the Ruby language to compile different layers and functionalities of code seamlessly together. This framework is extremely object oriented in nature. Ruby on Rails looks at virtually everything as an object.</p>

				<h4>Ruby On Rails Conventions</h4>
				
				<p>The Rails community is all about convention over configuration. While most development frameworks require pages of configuration code up front, Rails focuses on a set of strict naming conventions for structures and classes that significantly reduces the amount of necessary configuration. Hence, the work load for the developer is much simpler while still affording flexibility.</p>

				<p>Another convention that Rails developers are very keen on, is DRY code. What does DRY mean? DRY is simply a software development term that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself.  Efficiency is key. Creating pieces of code in a way that allows for those code blocks to only be stated once ,instead of multiple times throughout a program, saves valuable time and energy.</p>

				<h4>MCV</h4>

				<p>Ruby on Rails uses an architecture know as MCV. The MCV architecture is comprised of three main parts. Models, which are Ruby Classes that handle much of the back end logic and heavy lifting. The view is the piece that handles how the front end is displayed and how users will interact with an application. Finally, the controller i acts as the go-between for models and the view. This is the part that handles things like requests and initiating changes.</p>

				<h4>Benefits of Using Ruby On Rails</h4>

				<p>Let's take a look at what makes Rails such a great development framework. Well, first and foremost Rails is completely open source and free to use. Virtually anyone can use or contribute to the rails framework for faster application development. The Rails structure focuses on metaprogramming techniques to write programs which eliminates the need for a lot of extensive code generation from scratch. As you can imagine, this saves a great deal of time. Also, a convenient feature, the Rails framework comes with it’s own server, eliminating the need for a separate web server. This means everything can be developed and tested locally right from your machine. Finally, Ruby On Rails comes with many built in Ruby Gems and the ability to create and install new Gems. Ruby Gems are like pre-made modules or plug-ins. In fact, Rails itself is a Ruby Gem.
