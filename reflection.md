#Solo Challenge 3.5 Reflection

*What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

	I learned that working with padding, borders, and margins can be extremely tedious. Success with these CSS tools takes a little bit of math, planning, and tinkering. Borders for the sort of visible enclosure around the element. Padding provides the space between the outside of a container and it's content. Margins make up the space between elements. 

*What did you learn about CSS positioning?

	There are many options to consider when deciding how to position elements using CSS. in order to decide which positioning methods to use, you have to know how elements will interact with eachother in the browser. Quite a learning curve to this art. 

*What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

	The easiest aspects of the design to implement were font stylings, coloring different elements, and hover actions. The most, difficult for me, by far was positioning elements in the layout.  

*What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
	
	I did a little extra research and learned how to add and format social media icons.  I also learned that adding sections that are the same across all pages on your site can be easily accomplished and replicated by using the default.css method.
