		    	<h1>A Little Bit About me</h1>
		    	<h4>Background</h4>
		    	<p>For as long as I can remember, my pursuits in life have been driven by a passion for creativity and a hunger for knowledge. The medium for most of my creative drive has always been music. At the age of four, I found myself sitting in front of my grandmothers piano for hours at a time exploring the different combinations of tones I could produce and observing how those tonal combinations affected me on a visceral level. Over time this curiosity blossomed into a regimented practice routine, which naturally progressed to an academic journey in acquiring a degree in music composition and performance at Virginia Commonwealth University. As a musician, I had many wonderful opportunities including; Writing and arranging music for marching bands, touring with performing ensembles, recording studio albums, and composing music for media. During my time as a composer and performer, I would supplement my income by working at local bars around Brooklyn. While service industry work may seem like just a day job to some, I found it to be yet another creative outlet where I could express myself and further quench my thirst for knowledge. I was immediately drawn to the art of craft cocktails and spirit knowledge. The social aspect of the job was a bonus (yet another job where I get to be on stage and feel like a rockstar!). At the age of 28, I was approached by a roommate who introduced me to the seductive power of programming. Until that time, I had little to no experience in the tech world. As soon I began exploring the endless possibilities of and empowerment of communicating with my computer, I was hooked. Much like sitting in front of a piano with a sheet of staff paper, I found that sitting in front of my computer terminal with an idea was an empowering creative endeavor. There are no limits to the expressive capabilities that the world of coding affords us. I am excited about this new chapter in my life and I canâ€™t wait to share the content I create in this medium with the world.</p>
